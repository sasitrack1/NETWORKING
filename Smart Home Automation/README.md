# Smart Home Automation - Cisco Packet Tracer

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Smart Home Automation system simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network consists of multiple IoT (Internet of Things) devices connected to a central home gateway, enabling remote monitoring and control through a smartphone.

## Features
- **Home Gateway (DLC100)**: Acts as the central hub for all smart devices.
- **Smartphone Control**: Remotely controls and monitors smart home devices.
- **IoT Devices**:
  - **Smart Door**: Automated door lock/unlock system.
  - **Garage Door**: Remote-controlled garage access.
  - **Ceiling Fan**: Smart fan for automated cooling.
  - **Window**: Open/close mechanism for ventilation.
  - **Air Conditioner**: Temperature-controlled cooling system.
  - **Lawn Sprinkler**: Automated irrigation system.
  - **Webcam**: Security monitoring system.

## Network Configuration
- All IoT devices are wirelessly connected to the **Home Gateway (DLC100)**.
- A **Smartphone (SMARTPHONE-PT)** is used for remote access and control.
- Each IoT device sends and receives packets to/from the gateway for communication and automation.

## Simulation Steps
1. Open the **smart home.pkt** file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Click on each device to view its configuration and functionality.
3. Use the smartphone to control IoT devices (e.g., turn on the fan, open the garage door, etc.).
4. Monitor packet transmissions to analyze the communication between devices.

## Requirements
- **Cisco Packet Tracer 8.2 or later**
- Basic understanding of IoT networking and Cisco Packet Tracer simulation.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-world IoT protocols (MQTT, Zigbee, etc.).
- Implementation of AI-based automation for smart decision-making.
- Cloud-based remote access for better connectivity.
